# WikiScrape
The program will print the Wikipedia URL being queried and a list of tuples that contain the title of the article, the URL of the article, the image URL of the horse, other names the horse breed may have, the horse's country of origin, and any defining traits of the horse that are listed. This information is stored in the output file wikiScrape.csv.

Data is pulled from here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=xml&titles=List%20of%20horse%20breeds&prop=links&pllimit=500&
